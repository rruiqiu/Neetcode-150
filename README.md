I've solved over 300 LeetCode problems and come to deeply appreciate the value of structural thinking when approaching data structures and algorithms. Through this journey, I discovered that the NeetCode 150 problem set covers many of the most essential and practical coding patterns—ones that frequently appear in interviews and real-world software development.

To solidify my understanding and help others on the same path, I’m sharing my notes and solutions as I work through the NeetCode 150, highlighting patterns, optimizations, and key takeaways along the way.
